        <p id="pgph">I am an aspiring coding professional with a diverse background that includes everything from corporate social responsibility and public relations to graphic design and woodworking. This variety of experiences helps me approach projects from a creative and uncommon perspective. Twenty-five years as a Chicago sports fan has taught me the patience and problem-solving skills necessary to put this perspective into action.<br/><br/>I love to travel and can usually be found planning my next trip (Or, more likely, next several trips). My other interests include running, baking, reading, and convincing myself I like running. Born to a family of travel-enthusiasts, I have lived in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and New York, but have recently officially settled down in Atlanta with my husband, Will, and our cat, Ginny. </p>
